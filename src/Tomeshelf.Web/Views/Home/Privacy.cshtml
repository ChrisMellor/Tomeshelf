    Tomeshelf is a small application that displays publicly available Comic Con guest information.
    We do not run user accounts, and we do not sell or share personal information.
    This page explains what limited data is processed when you use the site and API.
    If anything here is unclear, please reach out via the project's GitHub issues.
    This policy applies to the Tomeshelf website and, where noted, the API.
    It does not apply to third-party sites that Tomeshelf links to.

    <h2 class="h4">Information We Process</h2>
    <p>
        When you browse the site, our servers may record standard web request information to operate the
        service and keep it secure. This includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Request details such as URL, HTTP method, timestamp, and response status code.</li>
        <li>Technical metadata such as IP address and user-agent supplied by your browser.</li>
        <li>Diagnostic timing data (e.g., request duration) used to monitor performance.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In development environments, additional HTTP request/response header logging may be enabled to
        help diagnose issues. This detailed diagnostic logging is not intended for production deployments.
    </p>
</section>

<section class="mb-4">
    <h2 class="h4">Cookies</h2>
    <p>
        Tomeshelf does not use cookies for tracking or advertising. The site may set strictly necessary
        cookies required for security or basic functionality of the web framework. These cookies, if present,
        do not track you across other websites.
    </p>
</section>

<section class="mb-4">
    <h2 class="h4">Telemetry and Metrics</h2>
    <p>
        The application includes optional observability (tracing/metrics) for reliability and capacity planning.
        When enabled by the operator, this data helps understand system health (e.g., request counts, latency,
        error rates) and is not used to profile individual users. Identifiers are limited to technical metadata
        required to operate the service.
    </p>
</section>

<section class="mb-4">
    <h2 class="h4">Data Sources and Sharing</h2>
    <p>
        Tomeshelf fetches public guest data from external Comic Con sources. We do not send your personal data to
        those sources when retrieving public information. Server logs and telemetry may be processed by the hosting
        platform or infrastructure providers strictly to operate the service.
    </p>
    <p>
        We do not sell personal information. We may disclose limited log information if required by law or to
        protect the security and integrity of the service.
    </p>
</section>

<section class="mb-4">
    <h2 class="h4">Retention</h2>
    <p>
        Diagnostic logs and metrics, when collected, are retained only as long as necessary for troubleshooting,
        security, and service operations, after which they are deleted or aggregated.
    </p>

<section class="mb-4">
    <h2 class="h4">Your Choices</h2>

        <li>You can configure your browser to block non-essential cookies.</li>
        <li>If you run your own instance of Tomeshelf, you control any logging and telemetry settings.</li>
    </ul>
